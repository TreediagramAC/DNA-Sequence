# DNA-Sequence
CSE232 Project3

Here is the project description.

For this project, we will be doing some bioinformatics (specifically genetics).
You will need to write functions involved with turning a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence (protein).
You will need to submit a folder (named "project3") with three files within:
"main.cpp": This file uses the function declarations in "bio.h" to convert a DNA sequence to an amino acid sequence. You should not modify this file.
"bio.h": This is the header file for "bio.cpp" and it should be modified to serve its purpose.
"bio.cpp": The skeleton code has comments and function signatures for the functions that "main.cpp" will use.
